4. Click **Save**

**Features:**

    ↑                                        ↓
    ←────────── Save & Return ──────────────┘
```

**From Dashboard:**
- Create New Design → Takes you to Room Form

**From Room Form:**
- Start Designing in 3D → Goes to 3D Studio

**From 3D Design Studio (Controls panel):**
- Dashboard → Return to Dashboard

- Save Design → Save current work
- Screenshot → Export PNG image
- Export Report → Download text summary
- Clear All → Remove all furniture

## 💾 Data Storage

### Local Storage
All designs are saved in your browser's local storage:
- **Key:** `room-design-storage`
- **Data:** Array of saved designs with full configuration
- **Persistence:** Data persists across browser sessions
- **Limitations:** Browser local storage limits apply (~5-10MB)

### Design Data Structure
Each saved design contains:
```javascript
{
  id: timestamp,
  name: "Your Design Name",
  roomConfig: { /* room specifications */ },
  furnitureItems: [ /* all furniture */ ],
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

## 🎨 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Save Frequently**
   - Save your work regularly to avoid losing progress
   - Use descriptive names for easy identification

2. **Organize Your Designs**
   - Use clear naming conventions (e.g., "Living Room - Modern", "Bedroom - Minimalist")
   - Delete old drafts to keep dashboard clean

3. **Export Your Work**
   - Use Screenshot to capture visual representation
   - Use Export Report for room specifications

4. **Experiment Freely**
   - Create multiple versions of the same room
   - Compare different furniture arrangements

## 🔄 Auto-Update vs Manual Save

- **Room Config & Furniture Placements:** Tracked in real-time but NOT auto-saved
- **Manual Save Required:** Click "Save Design" to persist changes
- **Editing Existing Design:** Updates the same design when you save again

## 🚀 Quick Start Workflow

1. Launch app → See Dashboard
2. Click "Create New Design"
3. Fill room specifications
4. Click "Start Designing in 3D"
5. Add and arrange furniture
6. Open Controls → "Save Design"
7. Name your design → Save

### Returning User:
1. Launch app → See Dashboard with saved designs
2. Click on a design card to resume editing
3. Make changes
4. Open Controls → "Save Design" (saves to same design)
5. Return to Dashboard to see updated timestamp
